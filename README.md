#Photogallery

This is a Next.js based website used to display different galleries. Next.js has been chosen because static serving is faster then dynamic. Other then that Next.js offers a lot of build in image manipulation.

This site will be linked to a Strapi API. When a new entry is made the project will rebuild.
